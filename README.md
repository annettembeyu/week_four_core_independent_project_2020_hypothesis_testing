# week_four_core_independent_project_2020_hypothesis_testing

##Description

In this project, my input as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company will be to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.
I will identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made. 

## Areas of interest
*Is the number of Bluecars taken in area X different than in area Y? Is it greater in area X than in area Z? This I will identify using the postal codes given in the dataset.
*I will look at  selected periods of interest be either weekdays or weekends but not a mix of both. 

## hypothesis testing
*It would be interesting to know whether the mean number of blue car taken in one area is the same as as another. This necessitates carrying out a two sample test.
*Whether the mean number of blue cars returned is the same as the mean number of blue cars returned in another area.

*Upon the findings that I will get recommend further investigation to explain the differences.
